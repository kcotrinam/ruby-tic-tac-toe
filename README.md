# :video_game: Object Oriented Programming: Ruby-Tic-Tac-Toe 

Welcome to our project "Object Oriented Programming: Ruby-Tic-Tac-Toe". The purpose of this project is to build a command line Tic-Tac-Toe game using OOP principles in Ruby.

## :hammer: Game Rules
  1. The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.
  2. Player 1 is X and player 2 is O.
  3. Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.
  4. The first player to get 3 of her marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.
  5. When all 9 squares are full, the game is over.
